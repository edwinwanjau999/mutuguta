            <h2>About Safari</h2>
            <p>The original safari dates back to the 14th century when Arabs made trading trips to east Africa. 
                They weren't interested in wildlife back then as their primary focus was trade, but these journeys, 
                like classic safaris, were planned for months, hence the term safari.</p>

            <p>Hosted Royalties
                Queen Elizabeth II was not the only royal to have gone on a safari adventure in Kenya.
                 In fact, a great number of royals have also made the journey to this African gem to 
                 catch a glimpse of the big five. Following his mother’s footsteps, Prince Charles has
                  also visited the Masai Mara national reserve, where he camped on the hills of Ol Donyo
                   Oseyia. You’d also be interested to know that Kenya is also where Prince William 
                   proposed to then Kate Middleton while on a safari in 2010!</p>
